## Unit 1 - Google Classroom Clone Project

## Objective
Create a simple front-end clone of Google Classroom that displays classes using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Requirements

1. **Data Structure**
   - Use an array of objects to represent classes
   - Each class object should include:
     * Unique identifier
     * Class name
     * Teacher name
     * Associated color

2. **User Interface**
   - Use insertAdjacentHTML + forEach to display a list of classes
   - Each class should be represented by a card showing:
     * Class name
     * Teacher name

3. **Functionality**
   - Dynamically generate class cards from the data structure
   - Ensure the page loads and displays classes without errors

4. **Code Organization**
   - **BONUS** Use functions to break down the problem into smaller parts
   - Keep your code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

5. **Styling**
   - Use CSS to create a clean, visually appealing interface
   - Make the design responsive for different screen sizes

## Thinking Points

- How can you structure your data to make it easy to add or remove classes?
- What's the best way to generate HTML elements using JavaScript?
- How can you make your code flexible for future enhancements?
- What additional features would make this clone more useful or realistic?

## Stretch Goals

- Add a feature to create new classes
- Implement a simple routing system to view class details
- Use local storage to persist data between page reloads

Remember, the goal is to understand the concepts and create a working prototype. Focus on problem-solving and creating clean, readable code.
